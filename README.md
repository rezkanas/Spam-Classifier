# Spam-Classifier
Given a set of testing data, with a bag of words encoding on each email message. We end up with a matrix of messages and their features, as binary encoded values. That is, for each email message, a feature x will be encoded to a 1 if it is present in an email message. Each email has 54 features, the first column of data being the class (0,1) indicating that it is spam or not.
